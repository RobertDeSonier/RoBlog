Wanting to explore SOLID outside the OO lens.  
Bringing more clarity to fellow Devs.


## Definition:

*A software artifact should be open for extension but closed for modification.* - Bertrand Meyer

## But what does it really mean:

OCP, at face value, sounds like a rule for maintenance, but in reality it must be considered during design.  
When considered from the beginning of a project, the rule is much easier to follow when maintaining the project.

A change in behavior should not require a change in the system, instead simply an extension of the system.
